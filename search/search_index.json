This involves solving a basic differential equation to establish the general form of the motion. Highlight how variations in initial conditions lead to a family of solutions. Solution Define the Forces Acting on the Projectile A projectile is subject to only one force (neglecting air resistance): Gravitational force acting downward: \\[ F=mg \\] \\[ 24=m6 \\] \\[ m=24/6 \\] \\[ m=4 \\] \\[ 24=4*6 \\] Analysis of the Range: Investigate how the horizontal range depends on the angle of projection. Discuss how changes in other parameters, such as initial velocity and gravitational acceleration, influence the relationship. Explanation The horizontal range of a projectile depends on the projection angle in a predictable way, governed by the equation: Sinusoidal Relationship: The range is proportional to sin(2\u03b8), which means it varies in a sinusoidal pattern with the angle. Sin(2\u03b8) reaches its maximum value of 1 when 2\u03b8 = 90\u00b0, or \u03b8 = 45\u00b0 At 45\u00b0, the projectile travels the farthest. As \ud835\udf03 increases beyond 45\u00b0, sin(2\ud835\udf03) decreases, causing the range to shorten. Symmetry The range for angles that add up to 90\u00b0 is the same. For example: R(30\u00b0) = R(60\u00b0) R(10\u00b0) = R(80\u00b0) This is because sin(20) = sin(180\u00b0 - 2\u03b8) Here\u2019s the graph showing the horizontal range as a function of the projection angle! You can see the symmetric curve peaking at 45\u00b0, with key points marked at 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 60\u00b0 to highlight the symmetry. Example \\[ R=(20)^2sin(2*45\u00b0) / 9.8 \\] \\[ R=400 * sin(90\u00b0) / 9.8 \\] \\[ R=400 * 1 / 9.8 \\] \\[ R\u224840.82 \\] The projectile travels about 40.82 meters. Practical Applications: Reflect on how this model can be adapted to describe various real-world situations, such as projectiles launched on uneven terrain or in the presence of air resistance. The \"Practical Applications\" section is asking you to think about how the basic idea of gravitation (Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation) applies to real-life situations that are more complicated than the simple examples we often see in textbooks. Let\u2019s break it down: What is the Gravitation Model? Your project already includes Newton\u2019s law of gravitation: This formula tells us the force (\ud835\udc39) between two objects (with masses \ud835\udc5a1 and \ud835\udc5a2) depends on how far apart they are (\ud835\udc5f) and a constant (\ud835\udc3a, which is ). In simple physics problems, we use this to calculate things like how a ball falls straight down or how planets orbit the Sun, assuming no other forces or complications. Parabolic Curve (Blue, Shorter Range): This represents the trajectory of a projectile (like a ball) launched at an angle, affected by gravity and likely air resistance. Straight Line (Blue, Longer Range): This represents a different scenario, possibly a projectile on a sloped terrain (like downhill) or with a different launch condition (e.g., higher velocity or no air resistance). Graph Details: X-Axis: Horizontal distance traveled (in meters), ranging from 0 to 250 meters. Y-Axis: Height (in meters), ranging from 0 to 35 meters. Parabolic Curve: Starts at (0,0), rises to a peak around 10 meters high at about 50 meters horizontally, then falls back to the ground around 100 meters. Straight Line: Starts at (0,0) and rises steadily, reaching about 35 meters high at 250 meters horizontally. Interpretation: Parabolic Curve: This is the typical path of a projectile in a vacuum or with air resistance on flat ground. Gravity pulls the projectile down, creating a curved (parabolic) trajectory. If air resistance is present, the range (horizontal distance) is reduced, which matches the shorter range (around 100 meters) seen here. Straight Line: This doesn\u2019t look like a typical projectile trajectory because it doesn\u2019t curve downward. It might represent: A projectile launched on a downhill slope, where the terrain keeps it moving farther without hitting the ground as quickly. A simplified model (e.g., ignoring gravity\u2019s downward pull for demonstration) or a different type of motion (like a rocket with constant upward thrust). The slope extends the range because the projectile doesn\u2019t hit the ground as soon\u2014it keeps traveling downward along the hill. Connection to Practical Applications: Uneven Terrain: The straight line could show how a downhill slope increases the range of a projectile compared to flat ground (parabolic curve). On a downhill slope, gravity still pulls the projectile down, but the slope allows it to travel farther horizontally before landing. Air Resistance: The parabolic curve likely includes air resistance (since its range is shorter than expected for a vacuum). Air resistance slows the projectile, reducing its range compared to an ideal scenario. Explanation for My Project: \u201cThis graph compares the trajectory of a projectile under two conditions. The parabolic curve (shorter range, around 100 meters) shows a projectile launched on flat ground, where gravity pulls it down and air resistance slows it, creating a typical curved path. The straight line (longer range, around 250 meters) represents a projectile launched on a downhill slope. The slope extends the range because the projectile follows the terrain, delaying its landing. This shows how uneven terrain adapts the gravitation model in real-world scenarios.\u201d Explanation of the Plot This plot represents the effect of air resistance on projectile motion. It compares two scenarios: No Air Resistance (Blue Curve) The projectile follows an ideal parabolic trajectory. The object reaches a higher peak and travels a longer horizontal distance. With Air Resistance (Red Curve) The trajectory is affected by air drag, reducing both the maximum height and horizontal range. The projectile slows down due to resistive forces, causing it to fall earlier. Key Observations Both curves start at the same initial point (the projectile is launched from the ground). The blue curve (no air resistance) follows a perfect parabola, which is the theoretical motion in a vacuum. The red curve (with air resistance) is lower and shorter due to energy loss from drag. The difference becomes more significant as the projectile moves farther, since air resistance continuously opposes motion.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#mechanics","text":"","title":"Mechanics"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#task-1","text":"","title":"Task 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#theoretical-foundation","text":"Begin by deriving the governing equations of motion from fundamental principles.
