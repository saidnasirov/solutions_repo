This involves solving a basic differential equation to establish the general form of the motion. Highlight how variations in initial conditions lead to a family of solutions. Solution Define the Forces Acting on the Projectile A projectile is subject to only one force (neglecting air resistance): Gravitational force acting downward: \\[ F=mg \\] \\[ 24=m6 \\] \\[ m=24/6 \\] \\[ m=4 \\] \\[ 24=4*6 \\] Phyton Code Solution Analysis of the Range: Investigate how the horizontal range depends on the angle of projection. Discuss how changes in other parameters, such as initial velocity and gravitational acceleration, influence the relationship. Solution The horizontal range of a projectile depends on the projection angle in a predictable way, governed by the equation: Sinusoidal Relationship: The range is proportional to sin(2\u03b8), which means it varies in a sinusoidal pattern with the angle. Sin(2\u03b8) reaches its maximum value of 1 when 2\u03b8 = 90\u00b0, or \u03b8 = 45\u00b0 At 45\u00b0, the projectile travels the farthest. As \ud835\udf03 increases beyond 45\u00b0, sin(2\ud835\udf03) decreases, causing the range to shorten. Symmetry The range for angles that add up to 90\u00b0 is the same. For example: R(30\u00b0) = R(60\u00b0) R(10\u00b0) = R(80\u00b0) This is because sin(20\u00b0) = sin(180\u00b0 - 2\u03b8) Here\u2019s the graph showing the horizontal range as a function of the projection angle! You can see the symmetric curve peaking at 45\u00b0, with key points marked at 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 60\u00b0 to highlight the symmetry.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#example","text":"\\[ E=mc^2 \\]","title":"EXAMPLE"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#mechanics","text":"","title":"Mechanics"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1_1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#task-1","text":"","title":"Task 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#theoretical-foundation","text":"Begin by deriving the governing equations of motion from fundamental principles.
