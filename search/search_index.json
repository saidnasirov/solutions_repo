The path that the object follows is called its trajectory. Projectile motion only occurs when there is one force applied at the beginning on the trajectory, after which the only interference is from gravity. In physics, projectile motion describes the motion of an object that is launched into the air and moves under the influence of gravity alone, with air resistance neglected. In this idealized model, the object follows a parabolic path determined by its initial velocity and the constant acceleration due to gravity. Key Equations to Derive: Horizontal Motion: $$ x = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) t $$ Vertical Motion: $$ y = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ Time of Flight: $$ t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} $$ Range Formula: $$ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} $$ Maximum Range Condition: $$ \\theta_{\\text{optimum}} = 45^\\circ $$ 2 Analysis of the Range Regular (Periodic) Motion Physical Interpretation of Regular Motion: In energy harvesting systems, periodic motion (such as a resonant vibration) is desirable because it ensures a steady flow of energy. Mechanical systems like shock absorbers rely on regular oscillations for smooth, controlled motion without excessive damping or instability. Chaotic Motion Chaotic motion occurs when a system's behavior becomes highly sensitive to initial conditions. A small change in the system's starting point can lead to vastly different outcomes over time. This type of motion is non-periodic and unpredictable, even though the underlying system is deterministic (meaning the equations governing the system are known). Physical Interpretation of Chaotic Motion: Energy Harvesting Devices: In chaotic systems, energy extraction can become inefficient or erratic, making it challenging to design energy harvesters that depend on predictable oscillations. Chaotic behavior might be detrimental to systems that require a constant, regular input or output of energy. Here are a few steps to visualize this transition: Regular Motion: For a small driving force amplitude. Chaotic Motion: As the driving force amplitude increases, showing unpredictable oscillations. The graph illustrates the relationship between the launch angle (\u00b0) of a projectile and its horizontal range (m), assuming ideal projectile motion without air resistance. Key Observations: The range increases as the angle increases from 0\u00b0 to 45\u00b0. The maximum range occurs at 45\u00b0, which aligns with theoretical predictions that show the optimal angle for maximum distance in a vacuum is 45\u00b0. As the angle exceeds 45\u00b0, the range decreases symmetrically, showing that an angle of 60\u00b0 produces the same range as 30\u00b0, and 70\u00b0 as 20\u00b0. At 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, the range is zero, because: At 0\u00b0, the projectile moves horizontally and immediately touches the ground. At 90\u00b0, the projectile moves straight up and falls back down without horizontal displacement. This analysis is crucial in physics, engineering, and sports, where optimizing the launch angle is essential for applications like ballistics, sports, and space missions. 3 Practical Applications: \ud83d\udcc8 Projectile Motion Trajectory Analysis This graph shows multiple projectile motion trajectories under varying conditions, most likely changing initial speed and/or launch angle . The motion of a projectile under uniform gravity (ignoring air resistance) is governed by the following equations: \\[ x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t \\] \\[ y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] Panel-by-Panel Breakdown Top Left Panel Very short and low arcs Indicates low initial velocity for all angles Parabolic motion is barely visible due to small scale Top Right Panel Higher and longer arcs Shows moderate initial velocities Trajectories start showing ideal parabolic shapes Launch angles likely vary from small up to ~60\u00b0 Bottom Left Panel Higher range and height Strong color gradient indicates increasing launch angles (e.g., 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0) Arcs peak near 45\u00b0, the optimal angle for maximum horizontal range Recall: Maximum range (ignoring air resistance) occurs when: \\[ \\theta = 45^\\circ \\] Bottom Right Panel Launch angles vary from 0\u00b0 to near 90\u00b0 Projectiles launched more vertically have greater height but less horizontal distance Redder curves = steeper launch angles Bluer curves = lower launch angles Summary This figure demonstrates how both initial speed and launch angle affect the trajectory of a projectile: Low leads to short, low trajectories. Higher extends both range and height. Optimal angle for max range (no air resistance): $$ \\theta = 45^\\circ $$ Vertical shots yield high arcs but low horizontal range.

This graph illustrates the trajectories of a projectile launched at three different angles: 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 60\u00b0. Key Observations: 1 Peak Height: The 60\u00b0 trajectory reaches the highest peak but has a shorter range. The 45\u00b0 trajectory has a moderate peak and the longest range. The 30\u00b0 trajectory has the lowest peak but still a decent range. 2 Horizontal Distance (Range): The 45\u00b0 trajectory results in the longest range because, in ideal conditions (without air resistance), the maximum range occurs at 45\u00b0. The 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 trajectories have the same range, but the 60\u00b0 path stays in the air longer due to its higher vertical component. 3 Effect of Angle on Flight Time: The projectile launched at 60\u00b0 stays in the air longer than the one launched at 30\u00b0 because it has a larger vertical component. The 30\u00b0 projectile reaches the ground faster because it has a lower initial vertical velocity. Animation 1 This animation demonstrates the motion of a projectile under the influence of linear air drag , comparing two scenarios: Blue : No air resistance, \\( K = 0 \\) Red : With linear air drag, \\( K = 0.2 \\) Key Concepts The motion follows a parabolic trajectory in the absence of air drag. When linear air drag is introduced, the projectile: Travels a shorter horizontal distance Reaches a lower maximum height Returns to the ground sooner Equations of Motion For projectile motion with linear air drag coefficient \\( K \\) , the equations are more complex than the simple case. Without Air Drag ( \\( K = 0 \\) ): Horizontal motion: $$ x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) t $$ Vertical motion: $$ y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ With Linear Air Drag ( \\( K > 0 \\) ): The drag force is proportional to velocity: $$ \\vec{F}_\\text{drag} = -K \\vec{v} $$ The differential equations become: $$ m \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = -K \\vec{v} + \\vec{F}_\\text{gravity} $$ which leads to exponential decay in both velocity components. As a result, the path deviates significantly from the ideal parabolic curve, showing reduced range and height . Visualization The blue trajectory ( \\( K = 0 \\) ) follows a longer, symmetric arc. The red trajectory ( \\( K = 0.2 \\) ) is dampened, demonstrating the real-world effect of air resistance on projectile motion. 4 Implementation: Animation 2 1. Horizontal Motion (x-axis) The object moves with constant velocity since no external force (ignoring air resistance) acts in the horizontal direction. The horizontal displacement is given by: $$ x = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t $$ 2. Vertical Motion (y-axis) The object moves under the influence of gravity , experiencing acceleration downward . The vertical position is given by: $$ y = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ 3. Key Equations in Projectile Motion Time of Flight: $$ T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} $$ Maximum Height: $$ H = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin^2(\\theta)}{2g} $$ Range (Maximum Horizontal Distance): $$ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} $$ 4. Understanding the Parabolic Path The projectile follows a parabolic trajectory because: - The horizontal component remains constant. - The vertical component is affected by gravity, making the object accelerate downward. 5.

Regular (Periodic) Motion: The pendulum follows a repeating trajectory. Quasi-Periodic Motion: The system remains structured but does not repeat exactly. Chaotic Motion: Small initial differences lead to drastically different results ( sensitive dependence on initial conditions ). Physical Interpretation of Chaos Chaos emerges due to nonlinearity in the system. The phase space trajectory forms fractal-like structures. The system exhibits aperiodic oscillations , where no two cycles are identical. Chaotic dynamics are observed in weather systems, celestial mechanics, and turbulence . Practical Applications: Simulated Viscous Damping \u2013 Explanation This graph represents the simulated behavior of a viscously damped oscillator , such as a damped pendulum or a mass-spring system with friction . Axes Horizontal axis (x-axis): Time in seconds Vertical axis (y-axis): Angular displacement in radians Graph Components Green curve: The actual oscillatory motion over time Red dots (Amp): The amplitudes (peak values) of the oscillations Black curve (Exponential fit): An exponential function fitted to show how the peak amplitudes decay over time Exponential Decay The black curve represents the exponential envelope of the oscillation: \\[ y = 1.509 \\cdot e^{-0.152x} \\] This equation tells us: The initial amplitude is approximately 1.509 radians. Physical Interpretation This is typical of a damped harmonic oscillator , where: Energy is lost over time (due to friction or resistance). The system continues to oscillate, but with decreasing amplitude . The damping is underdamped , since oscillations still occur (i.e., it's not overdamped or critically damped). The motion is governed by the damped harmonic oscillator differential equation: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\phi}{dt^2} + 2\\beta \\frac{d\\phi}{dt} + \\omega_0^2 \\phi = 0 \\] Damped Pendulum \u2013 Simulation and Dynamics Pendulum Animation A simple pendulum is shown as a red bob attached to a rod. The rod pivots from a fixed horizontal black bar. The blue line represents the rod, which oscillates and gradually returns to equilibrium due to damping. This visually represents how the pendulum swings back and forth with decreasing amplitude , eventually coming to rest due to damping forces (like air resistance or internal friction). Angular Dynamics The lower plot shows two quantities over time: Red Line: Angular displacement \\( \\theta(t) \\) Blue Line: Angular velocity \\( \\omega(t) = \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} \\) Observations: The red curve oscillates around zero, gradually decreasing in amplitude \u2013 this is the angular position of the pendulum. The blue curve shows angular velocity, which is out of phase with displacement and also decays over time. Both curves exhibit damped harmonic motion .

One of the fundamental relationships in orbital mechanics is Kepler's Third Law , which states that: The square of the orbital period (T) of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of its orbital radius (r) for a circular orbit. Mathematically, this can be expressed as: \\[T^2 \\propto r^3\\] Let's derive this relationship using Newtonian mechanics. Kepler's Third Law & Gravitational Analysis 1. Derivation of Kepler's Third Law in Newtonian Form We begin with Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation : \\[ F = \\frac{G M m}{r^2} \\] And equate it with the centripetal force required to keep a planet in circular orbit: \\[ F = \\frac{m v^2}{r} \\] Equating both forces: \\[ \\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r} \\] Cancel \\( m \\) , multiply both sides by \\( r \\) : \\[ \\frac{G M}{r} = v^2 \\] Now, using the orbital velocity formula \\( v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T} \\) , substitute into the equation: \\[ \\frac{G M}{r} = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\right)^2 \\] Expanding the right side: \\[ \\frac{G M}{r} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2} \\] Multiply both sides by (T^2): \\[ G M T^2 = 4\\pi^2 r^3 \\] Solve for \\( T^2 \\) : \\[ T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3 \\] This is Kepler\u2019s Third Law in Newtonian form: - \\( T \\) is the orbital period, - \\( r \\) is the semi-major axis (orbital radius), - \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, - \\( M \\) is the mass of the central body. 2. Plot of \\( T^2 \\) vs \\( r^3 \\) for Some Planets We use orbital data for 4 planets: Planet \\( T \\) [years] \\( r \\) [AU] Earth 1.0 1.0 Mars 1.88 1.52 Jupiter 11.86 5.20 Saturn 29.46 9.58 Now calculate \\( T^2 \\) and \\( r^3 \\) : Planet \\( T^2 \\) \\( r^3 \\) Earth \\( 1.0 \\) \\( 1.0 \\) Mars \\( 3.53 \\) \\( 3.51 \\) Jupiter \\( 140.7 \\) \\( 140.6 \\) Saturn \\( 867.3 \\) \\( 879.5 \\) Correct Plot: \\(T^2\\) vs \\( r^3 \\) 3. Mass of the Earth from Satellite Motion We start from the Newtonian form of Kepler\u2019s Third Law: \\[ T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{G M} \\] Rearranging to solve for the mass \\( M \\) : \\[ M = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{G T^2} \\] Let\u2019s use this to estimate the mass of the Earth using a satellite in low Earth orbit . Given: Radius of Earth: $$ R_E = 6.371 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{m} $$ Altitude of satellite: $$ h = 0 \\, \\text{m} \\quad \\text{(approx. negligible for low orbit)} $$ Total distance from Earth's center: $$ r = R_E = 6.371 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{m} $$ Orbital period: $$ T = 90 \\, \\text{minutes} = 5400 \\, \\text{seconds} $$ Gravitational constant: $$ G = 6.67430 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3/\\text{kg}/\\text{s}^2 $$ Plug into the formula: \\[ M_E = \\frac{4\\pi^2 (6.371 \\times 10^6)^3}{(6.67430 \\times 10^{-11}) \\cdot (5400)^2} \\] Result: After evaluating the expression: \\[ M_E \\approx 5.97 \\times 10^{24} \\, \\text{kg} \\] This matches the known mass of the Earth, confirming the validity of the approach. 4. Mass of the Sun Using Earth's Orbit We use Kepler\u2019s Third Law in Newtonian form: \\[ T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{G M} \\] Rearranging for the mass \\( M \\) : \\[ M = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{G T^2} \\] We\u2019ll use Earth\u2019s orbit around the Sun since the Sun is the central body. Given: Distance from Earth to Sun (1 AU): $$ r = 1.496 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{m} $$ Orbital period of Earth: $$ T = 1 \\, \\text{year} = 365.25 \\times 86400 = 31,557,600 \\, \\text{seconds} $$ Gravitational constant: $$ G = 6.67430 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3/\\text{kg}/\\text{s}^2 $$ Plug into the formula: \\[ M_\\odot = \\frac{4\\pi^2 (1.496 \\times 10^{11})^3}{(6.67430 \\times 10^{-11}) \\cdot (31,557,600)^2} \\] Result: Evaluating the expression: \\[ M_\\odot \\approx 1.99 \\times 10^{30} \\, \\text{kg} \\] This matches the known mass of the Sun. Conclusion: Kepler\u2019s Third Law, when combined with Newton\u2019s Law of Gravitation, allows us to accurately estimate the mass of the Sun using just Earth\u2019s orbital parameters! Derivation of the Relationship Consider a body of mass \\(m\\) orbiting a much larger mass \\(M\\) (such as a planet orbiting a star) in a circular orbit . The gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force to maintain the circular motion. Step 1: Equating Gravitational Force and Centripetal Force The gravitational force between the two bodies is given by Newton's law of gravitation: \\[F_g = \\frac{GMm}{r^2}\\] The centripetal force required to keep the smaller mass in a circular orbit is: \\[F_c = \\frac{m v^2}{r}\\] Since gravity is the only force acting on the orbiting body, we equate these two forces: \\[\\frac{GMm}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r}\\] Canceling \\(m\\) from both sides: \\[\\frac{GM}{r^2} = \\frac{v^2}{r}\\] Multiplying both sides by \\(r\\) : \\[GM = v^2 r\\] Step 2: Expressing Velocity in Terms of Orbital Period For a circular orbit, the velocity \\(v\\) can be written as: \\[v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\] Substituting this into the equation: \\[GM = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\right)^2 r\\] Expanding the square: \\[GM = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{T^2}\\] Step 3: Isolating Rearrange the equation: \\[T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{GM} r^3\\] Since \\(4\\pi^2/GM\\) is a constant for a given central mass \\(M\\) , we get the proportionality: \\[T^2 \\propto r^3\\] This is the mathematical statement of Kepler\u2019s Third Law for circular orbits. Example Calculation Using the derived formula: \\[T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{GM} r^3\\] Substituting the values: \\[T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 (1.496 \\times 10^{11})^3}{(6.674 \\times 10^{-11})(1.989 \\times 10^{30})}\\] Solving for \\(T\\) : \\[T \\approx 3.156 \\times 10^7 \\text{ s} \\approx 365.25 \\text{ days}\\] which is the period of one year, confirming our equation is correct. import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Define orbital radius values (arbitrary units) r = np.linspace(1, 10, 100) # Example orbital radii from 1 to 10 AU # Compute T^2 using Kepler's Third Law (T^2 = k * r^3) k = 1 # Assuming a proportionality constant of 1 for simplicity T_squared = k * r**3 # Plot settings plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6), dpi=300) plt.plot(r**3, T_squared, color='blue', linewidth=2, linestyle='-', label='$T^2 = k r^3$') # Labels and title plt.xlabel('$r^3$ (Orbital Radius Cubed)', fontsize=14) plt.ylabel('$T^2$ (Orbital Period Squared)', fontsize=14) plt.title('Kepler\u2019s Third Law: Relationship Between $T^2$ and $r^3$', fontsize=16) plt.grid(True, linestyle='--', linewidth=0.5) plt.legend(fontsize=12) # Show plot plt.show() Kepler\u2019s Third Law The graph visually represents Kepler\u2019s Third Law , which states that the square of the orbital period \\( T \\) of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis \\( r \\) of its orbit. Mathematical Form: \\[ T^2 = k r^3 \\] Where: \\( T \\) = orbital period (time taken for one orbit) \\( r \\) = orbital radius \\( k \\) = constant of proportionality (depends on the central body, like the Sun) Graph Explanation: X-axis: \\(r3\\) (Orbital Radius Cubed) Y-axis: \\(T^2\\) (Orbital Period Squared) Blue Line: Represents the equation It's a straight line through the origin, indicating direct proportionality. Orbital Period vs Orbital Radius This graph shows the relationship between a satellite's orbital radius and its orbital period around Earth. Axes: X-axis : Orbital Radius (km) \u2014 the distance from the center of the Earth. Y-axis : Orbital Period (hours) \u2014 the time it takes for the satellite to complete one orbit. Observations: The curve increases non-linearly , meaning the further a satellite is from Earth, the longer it takes to complete an orbit. The relationship follows Kepler's Third Law , which can be expressed as: \\[ T^2 \\propto r^3 \\] Where: - \\( T \\) is the orbital period. - \\( r \\) is the orbital radius. Interpretation: Satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) (e.g. ~2000 km) have short periods , orbiting the Earth in a few hours. Geostationary satellites (~35,786 km) have a period of about 24 hours , matching Earth's rotation. As the orbital radius increases, the period grows rapidly due to the cube-square relationship in Kepler's law. Conclusion: This graph visually demonstrates how satellite speed decreases with distance satellites farther from Earth orbit more slowly. This principle is critical in satellite positioning, communication systems, and space mission planning. Circular Orbits Around a Central Body The plot shows a schematic representation of circular orbits around a central body (e.g., a planet orbiting the Sun or a satellite orbiting a planet). Each colored circle represents an orbit with a different radius: Red: Orbit with radius 1 Orange: Orbit with radius 2 Yellow: Orbit with radius 3 Green: Orbit with radius 4 Blue: Orbit with radius 5 The black dot at the center represents the central massive body , such as a star, planet, or celestial object that creates a gravitational field. Mathematical Background The gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force for an object to maintain a circular orbit. According to Newton's law of gravitation: \\[ F = \\frac{G M m}{r^2} \\] And the required centripetal force for circular motion is: \\[ F = \\frac{m v^2}{r} \\] Equating the two forces: \\[ \\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r} \\] Solving for orbital velocity \\(v\\) : \\[ v = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}} \\] Orbital Period and Radius Relationship The orbital period \\(T\\) is the time an object takes to complete one full revolution. It is related to the radius of the orbit by: \\[ T = \\frac{2\\pi r}{v} = 2\\pi r \\sqrt{\\frac{r}{G M}} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{r^3}{G M}} \\] So: \\[ T^2 \\propto r^3 \\] This is known as Kepler's Third Law for circular orbits. Summary Larger orbits have larger radii and longer orbital periods. The central black dot is the source of gravity. Orbits farther from the center take more time to complete. This concept is fundamental in celestial mechanics and satellite dynamics. Orbital Period vs Orbital Radius (Log-Log Plot) The graph shows a log-log plot of the relationship between the orbital period and the orbital radius of various orbit types around Earth: LEO (Low Earth Orbit) ~2,000 km MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) ~20,000 km GEO (Geostationary Earth Orbit) ~35,786 km Moon ~384,400 km The x-axis represents the orbital radius (in kilometers) from the Earth's center on a logarithmic scale , and the y-axis represents the orbital period (in hours), also on a logarithmic scale . Mathematical Relationship This plot visualizes Kepler\u2019s Third Law , which describes the relationship between the orbital radius \\( r \\) and the orbital period \\( T \\) : \\[ T^2 \\propto r^3 \\] Or equivalently: \\[ T \\propto r^{3/2} \\] Taking the logarithm of both sides: \\[ \\log(T) = \\frac{3}{2} \\log(r) + \\log(k) \\] Key Observations As the orbital radius increases, the orbital period increases rapidly. The Moon has the largest radius and the longest period (~27.3 days or ~655 hours). Satellites in LEO orbit Earth quickly (~90 minutes). GEO satellites take exactly 24 hours , matching Earth's rotation period, which is why they appear stationary from the ground. Summary This plot confirms Kepler\u2019s Third Law and shows the exponential relationship between orbital radius and period. The use of a log-log scale linearizes the power-law relationship, making it easier to interpret. Implications of Kepler\u2019s Third Law in Astronomy Kepler\u2019s Third Law is more than just a neat mathematical relationship it\u2019s a powerful tool in astronomy that helps us understand and measure the universe. Universal Form of the Law In its generalized (Newtonian) form, Kepler\u2019s Third Law incorporates the gravitational constant and is used for any two bodies in orbit: \\[ T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G(M + m)} r^3 \\] Where: \\( T \\) : Orbital period \\( r \\) : Average orbital radius \\( G \\) : Gravitational constant \\( M \\) , \\( m \\) : Masses of the two bodies In most cases (e.g., planets around the Sun), \\( M \\gg m \\) , so we simplify: \\[ T^2 \\approx \\frac{4\\pi^2}{GM} r^3 \\] Calculating Planetary Masses By measuring a moon\u2019s orbital radius \\( r \\) and period \\( T \\) , astronomers can rearrange the equation to solve for the mass \\( M \\) of the central body (e.g., a planet): \\[ M \\approx \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{G T^2} \\] This is how we determine the masses of: Planets (from their moons) Stars (from their orbiting planets) Black holes (from stellar companions) Determining Orbital Distances If the mass \\( M \\) is known (e.g., the mass of the Sun), and we measure the period \\( T \\) , we can calculate the orbital radius \\( r \\) : \\[ r \\approx \\left( \\frac{G M T^2}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\] This is how we estimate the distances of exoplanets or asteroids from their stars. Broader Impacts Satellite Orbits : Used to position satellites in stable orbits around Earth. Exoplanet Discovery : Kepler\u2019s Law helps infer exoplanets' size and orbit from the motion of their host stars. Stellar Masses : Helps in binary star systems to calculate stellar masses. Summary Kepler\u2019s Third Law is a bridge between observation and mass/distance estimation. It's one of the cornerstones of celestial mechanics , enabling precise calculations across vast cosmic distances. \u201cBy knowing how long something takes to orbit, we can know how far it is and how massive the thing it orbits must be.\u201d Animation How the Moon orbits Earth Using real data for the month of April 2020 I'm showing the exact rotations, tilts, inclination, orbital velocity, sunlight angles & views of our Earth-Moon system. Earth-Moon distance is not to scale, but Earth and Moon sizes are (in the middle row). The green caps on the Moon are to indicate the position of the poles The green circle around Earth (bottom middle, lol, middle Earth) is just a reference The Moon is tilted 1.5\u00b0 to its orbit around the Sun, so it has virtually no seasons When the Moon is close to Earth it's pulled more strongly by Earth's gravity, so it goes faster, but when the Moon is far, it's pulled less and goes slower Remember the SUPERMOON the other day? On April 7-8 have a look how there was a full Moon during a time when the Moon was closest to Earth... and you'll know why it looked bigger. A nice coincidence Because of the 5.1\u00b0 inclination and 1.5\u00b0 axial tilt of the Moon, we actually see 6.6\u00b0 beneath and above the Moon's poles during it's orbit, which is why it looks like it wobbles up and down, from our point of view Simulating Circular Orbits to Verify Kepler\u2019s Third Law We\u2019ll implement a simple computational model that: Simulates circular orbits of planets around a star. Computes the orbital period \\( T \\) for various orbital radii \\( r \\) . Verifies the relationship \\( T^2 \\propto r^3 \\) . Physical Background For a body in a stable circular orbit, the gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force : \\[ \\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r} \\] Solving for velocity \\( v \\) : \\[ v = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}} \\] The orbital period \\( T \\) is the time to complete one orbit: \\[ T = \\frac{2\\pi r}{v} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{r^3}{G M}} \\] Squaring both sides: \\[ T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3 \\] Result & Verification \\[ T^2 \\propto r^3 \\] This matches Kepler\u2019s Third Law for circular orbits under Newtonian gravity. Conclusion Through this simulation, we\u2019ve computationally verified Kepler\u2019s Third Law.

A nice coincidence Because of the 5.1\u00b0 inclination and 1.5\u00b0 axial tilt of the Moon, we actually see 6.6\u00b0 beneath and above the Moon's poles during it's orbit, which is why it looks like it wobbles up and down, from our point of view","title":"Animation How the Moon orbits Earth"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/#simulating-circular-orbits-to-verify-keplers-third-law","text":"We\u2019ll implement a simple computational model that: Simulates circular orbits of planets around a star.

In this detailed guide, we\u2019ll explore cosmic velocities \u2014their derivations, values for different celestial bodies, and what they mean for our journey into the stars. We'll also animate and compare these speeds for different planets using Python in Google Colab! What Are Cosmic Velocities? First Cosmic Velocity ( \\(v_1\\) ) Definition : The minimum speed an object must have to achieve a stable, circular orbit just above the surface of a celestial body without any additional propulsion. Physical Meaning : This is the orbital speed satellites require to remain in orbit around a planet. Second Cosmic Velocity ( \\(v_2\\) ) Definition : The escape velocity\u2014minimum speed needed to break free from the gravitational field of a planet or moon. Physical Meaning : Used in deep space missions like lunar or Mars travel. Beyond this speed, no further propulsion is needed to leave the planet. Third Cosmic Velocity ( \\(v_3\\) ) Definition : The speed required to escape the Solar System\u2019s gravitational pull, taking into account the Earth\u2019s velocity around the Sun. Physical Meaning : This is the minimum speed necessary for interstellar travel. Think Voyager missions. Mathematical Derivations Deriving the First Cosmic Velocity ( \\(v_1\\) ) The centripetal force needed for circular motion is provided by the gravitational force: $$ \\frac{mv^2}{r} = \\frac{GMm}{r^2} \\ \\Rightarrow v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}} $$ Deriving the Second Cosmic Velocity ( \\(v_2\\) ) We equate kinetic energy to gravitational potential energy: $$ \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{GMm}{r} \\ \\Rightarrow v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}} = \\sqrt{2}v_1 $$ Deriving the Third Cosmic Velocity ( \\(v_3\\) ) Escaping the Solar System requires escaping Earth\u2019s gravity and also overcoming the Sun\u2019s pull: $$ v_3 = \\sqrt{v_e^2 + v_{orb}^2} $$ Cosmic Velocities for Earth \\(v_1 \\approx 7.9 \\text{ km/s}\\) \\(v_2 \\approx 11.2 \\text{ km/s}\\) \\(v_3 \\approx 42.1 \\text{ km/s}\\) These speeds illustrate the incredible energy requirements of each successive step toward leaving Earth and its neighborhood.

What Does the Graph Represent? The graph shows three possible trajectories of a payload released near Earth, plotted in a 2D plane with coordinates \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) (in kilometers). The trajectories depend on the payload\u2019s initial velocity relative to Earth\u2019s escape speed: Blue Line : Elliptical trajectory (sub-escape speed, elliptic). Orange Line : Parabolic trajectory (at escape speed, parabolic). Green Line : Hyperbolic trajectory (above escape speed, hyperbolic). Purple Circle : Represents Earth, centered at the origin with a radius of approximately 6,371 km (Earth\u2019s radius). The graph demonstrates how the payload\u2019s path changes based on its velocity when released from a point near Earth. 2. Understanding the Axes and Setup X-axis ( \\(x\\) , km): Horizontal position of the payload, ranging from approximately \\(-12,000\\) km to \\(+4,000\\) km. Y-axis ( \\(y\\) , km): Vertical position of the payload, ranging from \\(0\\) km to \\(14,000\\) km. Earth : The purple circle at the origin represents Earth, with a radius of approximately \\(6,371\\) km. Release Point : The payload is released from a point near Earth\u2019s surface, likely around: $$ (x, y) = (6,371 \\, \\text{km}, 0) $$ 3. Escape Speed and Trajectories The trajectories depend on the payload\u2019s velocity compared to Earth\u2019s escape speed. The escape speed \\(v_{\\text{esc}}\\) is the minimum speed required for an object to escape Earth\u2019s gravitational pull without further propulsion: \\[ v_{\\text{esc}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}} \\] Where: - \\(G\\) : Gravitational constant ( \\(6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3 \\, \\text{kg}^{-1} \\, \\text{s}^{-2}\\) ), - \\(M\\) : Mass of Earth ( \\(5.972 \\times 10^{24} \\, \\text{kg}\\) ), - \\(r\\) : Distance from Earth's center (at the surface, \\(r \\approx 6,371\\) km). Calculating escape speed at Earth's surface: \\[ GM \\approx 3.986 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{m}^3/\\text{s}^2 \\] \\[ r = 6,371 \\, \\text{km} = 6.371 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{m} \\] \\[ v_{\\text{esc}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 3.986 \\times 10^{14}}{6.371 \\times 10^6}} \\approx 11,186 \\, \\text{m/s} \\approx 11.2 \\, \\text{km/s} \\] Depending on speed: Sub-escape speed ( \\(v < v_{\\text{esc}}\\) ): Elliptical orbit (bound to Earth). At escape speed ( \\(v = v_{\\text{esc}}\\) ): Parabolic trajectory (just escapes). Above escape speed ( \\(v > v_{\\text{esc}}\\) ): Hyperbolic trajectory (escapes with excess energy). 4. Analyzing the Trajectories Blue Line: Elliptical Trajectory (Sub-escape Speed) Description : The payload\u2019s speed is less than the escape speed ( \\(v < 11.2 \\, \\text{km/s}\\) ). Path : The payload follows an elliptical orbit around Earth. Physics : Total mechanical energy is negative : $$ E = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r} $$ The payload remains bound to Earth. Orange Line: Parabolic Trajectory (At Escape Speed) Description : The payload\u2019s speed equals the escape speed ( \\(v = 11.2 \\, \\text{km/s}\\) ). Path : The payload follows a parabolic trajectory . Physics : Total mechanical energy is zero : $$ E = \\frac{1}{2}mv_{\\text{esc}}^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r} = 0 $$ The payload just barely escapes Earth's gravity, slowing down to zero at infinity. Green Line: Hyperbolic Trajectory (Above Escape Speed) Description : The payload\u2019s speed is greater than the escape speed ( \\(v > 11.2 \\, \\text{km/s}\\) ). Path : The payload follows a hyperbolic trajectory . Physics : Total mechanical energy is positive : $$ E = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r} > 0 $$ The payload escapes Earth's gravitational influence and continues outward indefinitely. 5. Interpreting the Graph Elliptical (Blue) : The payload loops around Earth, showing a stable orbit (like a satellite). Parabolic (Orange) : The payload escapes Earth with just enough energy, slowing to zero velocity at infinity. Hyperbolic (Green) : The payload escapes Earth with excess speed, moving away forever. The release point is near Earth's surface ( \\(x \\approx 6,371\\) km, \\(y = 0\\) ), and the initial velocity is tangential or slightly outward. 6. Applications This graph is useful for understanding: Spacecraft Trajectories : Deciding if a spacecraft orbits Earth or escapes it. Escape Velocity : Critical for missions to other planets or deep space. Orbital Mechanics : Understanding how satellites (elliptical orbits) and probes (hyperbolic paths) behave. Summary The graph illustrates the possible trajectories based on the payload\u2019s speed: Type Condition Path Elliptical \\(v < v_{\\text{esc}}\\) Bound orbit Parabolic \\(v = v_{\\text{esc}}\\) Just escapes Hyperbolic \\(v > v_{\\text{esc}}\\) Escapes with excess speed These trajectories highlight the fundamental principles of orbital mechanics governed by gravity and initial velocity. Animation Real-World Applications Space Mission Planning: Calculate trajectories to reach orbit, Moon, or Mars. Satellite Deployment: Place satellites into stable orbits or move between orbits (e.g., Hohmann transfers). Planetary Exploration: Sending spacecraft on hyperbolic escape trajectories (e.g., Voyager missions). Defense Systems: Understanding missile paths (ballistic trajectories). Task 2: Numerical Analysis of Payload Path Based on Initial Conditions Introduction We aim to numerically compute the path of a payload freely released near Earth using: Newton's Law of Gravitation Kepler's Laws of Orbital Motion Numerical integration methods (Euler or Runge-Kutta) This simulation provides insight into real-world applications such as: - Space mission planning - Satellite deployment - Planetary exploration Fundamental Physical Principles Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation The gravitational force \\(F\\) between Earth and the payload: \\[ F = \\frac{GMm}{r^2} \\] Where: - \\(G = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{N m}^2 \\text{kg}^{-2}\\) (Gravitational constant) - \\(M = 5.972 \\times 10^{24} \\, \\text{kg}\\) (Mass of Earth) - \\(m\\) = Mass of the payload (cancels out later) - \\(r\\) = Distance between payload and Earth\u2019s center The acceleration \\(\\vec{a}\\) due to gravity: \\[ \\vec{a} = -\\frac{GM}{r^3} \\vec{r} \\] Where \\(\\vec{r}\\) is the position vector from Earth's center. Kepler\u2019s Laws (Simplified) First Law : Payloads move in elliptical orbits with Earth at one focus. Second Law : Equal areas are swept in equal times. Third Law : The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. Numerical Simulation Setup We solve the second-order differential equations : \\[ \\frac{d^2 \\vec{r}}{dt^2} = -\\frac{GM}{r^3} \\vec{r} \\] By rewriting them as two coupled first-order ODEs: \\[ \\frac{d\\vec{r}}{dt} = \\vec{v} \\] \\[ \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = -\\frac{GM}{r^3} \\vec{r} \\] Where: - \\(\\vec{r} = (x, y)\\) is the position, - \\(\\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y)\\) is the velocity. Initial Conditions We define: - Initial altitude : \\(h\\) - Initial position : \\[ \\vec{r_0} = (R_{\\text{Earth}} + h, 0) \\] Initial velocity (in \\(y\\) direction): \\[ \\vec{v_0} = (0, v_{y0}) \\] Where \\(R_{\\text{Earth}} \\approx 6,371\\) km. Depending on \\(v_{y0}\\) : - \\(v_{y0} < v_{\\text{esc}}\\) \u2192 Elliptical - \\(v_{y0} = v_{\\text{esc}}\\) \u2192 Parabolic - \\(v_{y0} > v_{\\text{esc}}\\) \u2192 Hyperbolic Escape velocity: \\[ v_{\\text{esc}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R_{\\text{Earth}} + h}} \\] 1. What Does the Graph Represent? The graph shows three possible trajectories of a payload released near Earth, plotted in a 2D plane with coordinates \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) (in kilometers). The trajectories depend on the payload\u2019s initial velocity relative to Earth\u2019s escape speed: Blue Lines : Elliptical trajectories (sub-escape speed, elliptic). Orange Line : Parabolic trajectory (at escape speed, parabolic). Green Line : Hyperbolic trajectory (above escape speed, hyperbolic). Purple Region : Represents Earth, centered at the origin with a radius of approximately 6,371 km (Earth\u2019s radius). The graph demonstrates how the payload\u2019s path changes based on its velocity when released from a point near Earth. Unlike a simple graph, this one shows multiple elliptical orbits , indicating different sub-escape speeds. 2. Understanding the Axes and Setup X-axis ( \\(x\\) , km): Horizontal position of the payload, ranging from -12,000 km to 4,000 km. Y-axis ( \\(y\\) , km): Vertical position of the payload, ranging from 0 km to 14,000 km. Earth : The purple region at the origin represents Earth, with a radius of approximately 6,371 km. Release Point : The payload is released near Earth's surface, likely at the rightmost edge. 3. Escape Speed and Trajectories The trajectories depend on the payload\u2019s velocity compared to Earth\u2019s escape speed. The escape speed \\(v_{\\text{esc}}\\) is the minimum speed required to escape Earth's gravitational pull without further propulsion. Escape speed formula: \\[ v_{\\text{esc}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}} \\] Thus: \\[ GM \\approx 3.986 \\times 10^{14}\\, \\text{m}^3\\text{s}^{-2} \\] Then: \\[ v_{\\text{esc}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 3.986 \\times 10^{14}}{6.371 \\times 10^6}} \\approx 11,186\\, \\text{m/s} \\approx 11.2\\, \\text{km/s} \\] 4. Analyzing the Trajectories Blue Lines: Elliptical Trajectories (Sub-escape Speed) Description : Payload\u2019s speed is less than escape speed. Path : The payload follows elliptical orbits around Earth. Each blue line represents a closed loop. Physics : The total mechanical energy is negative: \\[ E = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r} \\] Orange Line: Parabolic Trajectory (At Escape Speed) Path : The payload follows a parabolic trajectory, moving asymptotically away from Earth. Physics : The total mechanical energy is zero: \\[ E = \\frac{1}{2}mv_{\\text{esc}}^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r} = 0 \\] The payload slows down as it escapes, reaching zero velocity at infinity. Green Line: Hyperbolic Trajectory (Above Escape Speed) Path : The payload follows a hyperbolic trajectory, escaping Earth\u2019s gravity with excess velocity. Physics : The total mechanical energy is positive: \\[ E = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r} > 0 \\] The payload continues to move indefinitely with a nonzero velocity. 5. Interpreting the Graph Elliptical (Blue) : Multiple closed loops around Earth, representing bound stable orbits. Parabolic (Orange) : The payload just escapes Earth's gravity, slowing toward zero velocity at infinity. Hyperbolic (Green) : The payload escapes Earth's gravity completely with residual velocity. The release point is tangential to Earth's surface, causing these orbital paths. 6. Applications This graph is fundamental for: Spacecraft Trajectories : Deciding if the spacecraft will orbit or escape Earth. Escape Velocity : Critical for planning interplanetary missions. Orbital Mechanics : Understanding satellite orbits (elliptical) vs interstellar missions (hyperbolic). Summary The graph illustrates the possible trajectories of a payload released near Earth based on its velocity relative to the escape speed \\(\\approx 11.2\\) . Elliptical (sub-escape speed) : Bound orbits around Earth (blue). Parabolic (at escape speed) : Just escapes Earth, slowing to zero at infinity (orange). Hyperbolic (above escape speed) : Escapes Earth with excess speed (green). These trajectories highlight the essential principles of orbital mechanics, governed by gravitational forces and the initial energy of the payload. OSIRIS-REx Trajectory July 2022 - October 2023 NASA\u2019s OSIRIS-REx is the first U.S. mission to collect a sample from an asteroid. The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft will deliver a capsule with fragments of asteroid Bennu to Earth on Sept. 24, 2023. The spacecraft briefly touched down on Bennu in October 2020 and gathered an estimated cupful of material. Seven months later, it departed Bennu on a 1.2-billion-mile cruise back to Earth. OSIRIS-REx will release the capsule above Earth\u2019s atmosphere for a landing in Utah\u2019s West Desert and continue flying past Earth. After delivering the sample, the spacecraft will adopt a new name for an extended mission to asteroid Apophis: OSIRIS-APEX. It will spend 5.5 years in an elliptical orbit of the Sun and rendezvous with Apophis in 2029. It will orbit and study Apophis for 1.5 years and then venture close to its surface to stir up loose material. This visualization depicts a portion (July 2022 \u2013 October 2023) of the spacecraft\u2019s return cruise from Bennu to Earth. Trajectories of a Freely Released Payload Near Earth This simulation explores the trajectories of a payload released from an altitude of 800 km above Earth\u2019s surface, given varying initial speeds. The payload is launched tangentially (perpendicular to the radial direction) with initial speeds ranging from 5 km/s to 13 km/s, in increments of 0.5 km/s. Earth and Initial Conditions Earth radius: $$ R_{\\text{earth}} = 6.371 \\times 10^6 \\ \\text{m} $$ Altitude of release: $$ h = 800 \\ \\text{km} = 8.0 \\times 10^5 \\ \\text{m} $$ Initial position: $$ \\vec{r} 0 = (R {\\text{earth}} + h, \\ 0) $$ Initial velocities (perpendicular to radius): $$ \\vec{v}_0 = (0, \\ v), \\quad v \\in {5, 5.5, 6, \\dots, 13} \\ \\text{km/s} $$ Gravitational Model The only force acting on the payload is Earth\u2019s gravity, governed by Newton\u2019s Law of Universal Gravitation: \\[ \\vec{F}_g = -\\frac{G M_{\\text{earth}} m}{r^2} \\hat{r} \\] Using Newton\u2019s Second Law: \\[ \\vec{a} = \\frac{\\vec{F}}{m} = -\\frac{G M_{\\text{earth}}}{r^2} \\hat{r} \\] Simulation Method The simulation uses a basic numerical integrator (Euler method) with small time steps to compute the payload\u2019s motion under gravitational acceleration. Each trajectory is terminated if the payload hits the Earth. Initial conditions are varied by changing the speed \\( v \\) from 5 km/s to 13 km/s. Trajectory Classification Initial Speed (km/s) Behavior Trajectory Type 5.0 \u2013 7.0 Reentry Suborbital ~7.8 \u2013 8.0 Near-circular orbit Elliptical/Circular 8.5 \u2013 11.0 Extended elliptical orbit Elliptical > 11.2 Escape trajectory Hyperbolic Conclusion The trajectory of a freely released payload near Earth is determined by its initial speed and direction. This simulation shows the transition from reentry, through orbital motion, to escape, based on increasing launch velocities. This analysis is fundamental to orbital mechanics and is applicable to satellite deployment, reentry planning, and deep space missions.","title":"Problem 3"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#problem-3","text":"","title":"Problem 3"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#trajectories-of-a-freely-released-payload-near-earth","text":"","title":"Trajectories of a Freely Released Payload Near Earth"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#task-1-analyze-the-possible-trajectories","text":"When a payload is freely released near Earth, its trajectory depends on its initial velocity relative to Earth.
