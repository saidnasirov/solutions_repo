# Problem 1

# Problem description
## Theoretical Foundation:

Begin by deriving the governing equations of motion from fundamental principles. This involves solving a basic differential equation to establish the general form of the motion.
Highlight how variations in initial conditions lead to a family of solutions.

# Solution
## Step one
Define the Forces Acting on the Projectile
A projectile is subject to only one force (neglecting air resistance):

Gravitational force acting downward:

$$
F=mg
$$

$$
24=m6
$$

$$
m=24/6
$$

$$
m=4
$$

$$
24=4*6
$$
