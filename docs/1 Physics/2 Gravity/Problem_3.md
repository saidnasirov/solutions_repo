# Problem 3

# Trajectories of a Freely Released Payload Near Earth

## Task 1 - Analyze the Possible Trajectories

When a payload is freely released near Earth, its trajectory depends on its initial velocity relative to Earth. The possible types of trajectories include:

- **Elliptical Orbit** (Bound orbit, $e < 1$)
- **Parabolic Trajectory** (Escape trajectory, $e = 1$)
- **Hyperbolic Trajectory** (Unbound trajectory, $e > 1$)

Where $e$ is the eccentricity of the trajectory.

### Fundamental Principles

1. **Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation:**

$$
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
$$

Where:
- $F$ is the gravitational force,
- $G$ is the gravitational constant ($6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{m^3 \, kg^{-1} \, s^{-2}}$),
- $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses,
- $r$ is the distance between their centers.

2. **Newton's Second Law:**

$$
F = m a
$$

Combining with gravitational force:

$$
a = G \frac{M}{r^2}
$$

where $M$ is the mass of the Earth.

3. **Conservation of Energy:**

Total specific mechanical energy $\epsilon$ (energy per unit mass) is:

$$
\epsilon = \frac{v^2}{2} - \frac{G M}{r}
$$

- If $\epsilon < 0$: **Elliptical Orbit**
- If $\epsilon = 0$: **Parabolic Escape**
- If $\epsilon > 0$: **Hyperbolic Escape**

4. **Keplerâ€™s Laws:**
- First Law: Orbit of a planet (or satellite) is an ellipse with the Earth at one focus.
- Second Law: Line joining satellite and Earth sweeps equal areas in equal times.
- Third Law: The square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis.

$$
T^2 \propto a^3
$$

## Example Scenarios

| Initial Velocity | Trajectory Type | Application Example |
| :--------------- | :-------------- | :------------------ |
| Less than circular orbital velocity | Elliptical orbit | Low Earth Orbit satellites |
| Equal to circular orbital velocity | Circular orbit (special ellipse) | GPS satellites |
| Greater than circular but less than escape velocity | Elliptical orbit | Transfer orbits |
| Escape velocity exactly | Parabolic trajectory | Escape to interplanetary space |
| Greater than escape velocity | Hyperbolic trajectory | Interstellar probes (Voyager 1/2) |

### Important Values (Near Earth's Surface)

- Circular orbital speed:

$$
v_c = \sqrt{ \frac{G M}{r} } \approx 7.8 \, \text{km/s}
$$

- Escape speed:

$$
v_{esc} = \sqrt{2} v_c \approx 11.2 \, \text{km/s}
$$

## Simulation and Visualization

We'll simulate a payload trajectory under Earth's gravity using numerical integration (Euler method for simplicity).

Below is Python code for **Google Colab**:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Constants
G = 6.67430e-11           # gravitational constant (m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)
M_earth = 5.972e24        # mass of Earth (kg)
R_earth = 6371e3          # radius of Earth (m)
mu = G * M_earth          # standard gravitational parameter

    specific_energy = 0.5 * v0**2 - mu / r0
    if np.isclose(specific_energy, 0, atol=1e5):  # Near zero energy
        return "Parabolic"
    elif specific_energy > 0:
        return "Hyperbolic"
    else:
        return "Elliptical"

    steps = int(t_max / dt)
    r = r0.copy()
    v = v0_vec.copy()
    trajectory = np.zeros((steps, 2), dtype=float)
    trajectory[0] = r

    for i in range(1, steps):
        r_norm = np.linalg.norm(r)
        a = -mu / r_norm**3 * r
        v += a * dt
        r += v * dt

        if r_norm < R_earth:
            print(f"Crashed into Earth at t={i*dt} s")
            return trajectory[:i]
        
        if r_norm > 30*R_earth:  # Far away = escaped
            print(f"Escaped Earth's gravity at t={i*dt} s")
            return trajectory[:i]

    return trajectory

# Initial Conditions
altitude = 500e3  # 500 km above Earth
r0 = np.array([R_earth + altitude, 0.0], dtype=float)

# Theoretical escape velocity
v_escape = np.sqrt(2 * mu / np.linalg.norm(r0))
print(f"Theoretical escape velocity: {v_escape/1000:.2f} km/s")

# Different cases to try
cases = {
    'Elliptical (sub-escape speed)': 0.9 * v_escape,
    'Parabolic (escape speed)': 1.0 * v_escape,
    'Hyperbolic (above escape speed)': 1.2 * v_escape
}

# Plot all cases
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 12))

for label, v0 in cases.items():
    v0_vec = np.array([0.0, v0], dtype=float)  # pure y-velocity
    orbit_kind = orbit_type(np.linalg.norm(v0_vec), np.linalg.norm(r0))
    print(f"\nðŸ”µ {label}: {orbit_kind} orbit")
    traj = simulate_orbit(r0.copy(), v0_vec.copy())

## 1. What Does the Graph Represent?
The graph shows three possible trajectories of a payload released near Earth, plotted in a 2D plane with coordinates \( x \) and \( y \) (in kilometers). The trajectories depend on the payloadâ€™s initial velocity relative to Earthâ€™s escape speed:

- **Blue Line**: Elliptical trajectory (sub-escape speed, elliptic).
- **Orange Line**: Parabolic trajectory (at escape speed, parabolic).
- **Green Line**: Hyperbolic trajectory (above escape speed, hyperbolic).
- **Purple Circle**: Represents Earth, centered at the origin with a radius of approximately 6,371 km (Earthâ€™s radius).

The graph demonstrates how the payloadâ€™s path changes based on its velocity when released from a point near Earth.

---

## 2. Understanding the Axes and Setup

- **X-axis** ($x$, km): Horizontal position of the payload, ranging from approximately $-12,000$ km to $+4,000$ km.
- **Y-axis** ($y$, km): Vertical position of the payload, ranging from $0$ km to $14,000$ km.
- **Earth**: The purple circle at the origin represents Earth, with a radius of approximately $6,371$ km.
- **Release Point**: The payload is released from a point near Earthâ€™s surface, likely around:
  $$
  (x, y) = (6,371 \, \text{km}, 0)
  $$

---

## 3. Escape Speed and Trajectories

The trajectories depend on the payloadâ€™s velocity compared to Earthâ€™s escape speed.

The escape speed $v_{\text{esc}}$ is the minimum speed required for an object to escape Earthâ€™s gravitational pull without further propulsion:

$$
v_{\text{esc}} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}
$$

Where:
- $G$: Gravitational constant ($6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2}$),
- $M$: Mass of Earth ($5.972 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg}$),
- $r$: Distance from Earth's center (at the surface, $r \approx 6,371$ km).

Calculating escape speed at Earth's surface:

$$
GM \approx 3.986 \times 10^{14} \, \text{m}^3/\text{s}^2
$$

$$
r = 6,371 \, \text{km} = 6.371 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}
$$

$$
v_{\text{esc}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 3.986 \times 10^{14}}{6.371 \times 10^6}} \approx 11,186 \, \text{m/s} \approx 11.2 \, \text{km/s}
$$

### Depending on speed:
- **Sub-escape speed** ($v < v_{\text{esc}}$): Elliptical orbit (bound to Earth).
- **At escape speed** ($v = v_{\text{esc}}$): Parabolic trajectory (just escapes).
- **Above escape speed** ($v > v_{\text{esc}}$): Hyperbolic trajectory (escapes with excess energy).

---

## 4. Analyzing the Trajectories

### Blue Line: Elliptical Trajectory (Sub-escape Speed)

- **Description**: The payloadâ€™s speed is less than the escape speed ($v < 11.2 \, \text{km/s}$).
- **Path**: The payload follows an **elliptical orbit** around Earth.
- **Physics**: 
  - Total mechanical energy is **negative**:
    $$
    E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{GMm}{r}
    $$
  - The payload remains bound to Earth.

---

### Orange Line: Parabolic Trajectory (At Escape Speed)

- **Description**: The payloadâ€™s speed equals the escape speed ($v = 11.2 \, \text{km/s}$).
- **Path**: The payload follows a **parabolic trajectory**.
- **Physics**: 
  - Total mechanical energy is **zero**:
    $$
    E = \frac{1}{2}mv_{\text{esc}}^2 - \frac{GMm}{r} = 0
    $$
  - The payload just barely escapes Earth's gravity, slowing down to zero at infinity.

---

### Green Line: Hyperbolic Trajectory (Above Escape Speed)

- **Description**: The payloadâ€™s speed is greater than the escape speed ($v > 11.2 \, \text{km/s}$).
- **Path**: The payload follows a **hyperbolic trajectory**.
- **Physics**: 
  - Total mechanical energy is **positive**:
    $$
    E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{GMm}{r} > 0
    $$
  - The payload escapes Earth's gravitational influence and continues outward indefinitely.

---

## 5. Interpreting the Graph

- **Elliptical (Blue)**: The payload loops around Earth, showing a stable orbit (like a satellite).
- **Parabolic (Orange)**: The payload escapes Earth with just enough energy, slowing to zero velocity at infinity.
- **Hyperbolic (Green)**: The payload escapes Earth with excess speed, moving away forever.

The **release point** is near Earth's surface ($x \approx 6,371$ km, $y = 0$), and the **initial velocity** is tangential or slightly outward.

---

## 6. Applications

This graph is useful for understanding:

- **Spacecraft Trajectories**: Deciding if a spacecraft orbits Earth or escapes it.
- **Escape Velocity**: Critical for missions to other planets or deep space.
- **Orbital Mechanics**: Understanding how satellites (elliptical orbits) and probes (hyperbolic paths) behave.

# Summary
The graph illustrates the possible trajectories based on the payloadâ€™s speed:

| Type        | Condition                | Path      |
|:------------|:--------------------------|:----------|
| Elliptical  | $v < v_{\text{esc}}$       | Bound orbit |
| Parabolic   | $v = v_{\text{esc}}$       | Just escapes |
| Hyperbolic  | $v > v_{\text{esc}}$       | Escapes with excess speed |

These trajectories highlight the fundamental principles of orbital mechanics governed by gravity and initial velocity.

## Task 2: Numerical Analysis of Payload Path Based on Initial Conditions

---

## Introduction

We aim to **numerically compute** the path of a payload **freely released** near Earth using:

- **Newton's Law of Gravitation**
- **Kepler's Laws of Orbital Motion**
- **Numerical integration methods** (Euler or Runge-Kutta)

This simulation provides insight into **real-world applications** such as:
- Space mission planning 
- Satellite deployment 
- Planetary exploration 

---

## Fundamental Physical Principles

### Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

The gravitational force $F$ between Earth and the payload:

$$
F = \frac{GMm}{r^2}
$$

Where:
- $G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N m}^2 \text{kg}^{-2}$ (Gravitational constant)
- $M = 5.972 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg}$ (Mass of Earth)
- $m$ = Mass of the payload (cancels out later)
- $r$ = Distance between payload and Earthâ€™s center

The **acceleration** $\vec{a}$ due to gravity:

$$
\vec{a} = -\frac{GM}{r^3} \vec{r}
$$

Where $\vec{r}$ is the position vector from Earth's center.

---

### Keplerâ€™s Laws (Simplified)

- **First Law**: Payloads move in elliptical orbits with Earth at one focus.
- **Second Law**: Equal areas are swept in equal times.
- **Third Law**: The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis.

---

## Numerical Simulation Setup

We solve the **second-order differential equations**:

$$
\frac{d^2 \vec{r}}{dt^2} = -\frac{GM}{r^3} \vec{r}
$$

By rewriting them as two coupled **first-order** ODEs:

$$
\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} = \vec{v}
$$

$$
\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = -\frac{GM}{r^3} \vec{r}
$$

Where:
- $\vec{r} = (x, y)$ is the position,
- $\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y)$ is the velocity.

---

### Initial Conditions

We define:
- **Initial altitude**: $h$
- **Initial position**: 

$$
\vec{r_0} = (R_{\text{Earth}} + h, 0)
$$

- **Initial velocity** (in $y$ direction):

$$
\vec{v_0} = (0, v_{y0})
$$

Where $R_{\text{Earth}} \approx 6,371$ km.

Depending on $v_{y0}$:
- $v_{y0} < v_{\text{esc}}$ â†’ Elliptical
- $v_{y0} = v_{\text{esc}}$ â†’ Parabolic
- $v_{y0} > v_{\text{esc}}$ â†’ Hyperbolic

Escape velocity:

$$
v_{\text{esc}} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R_{\text{Earth}} + h}}
$$

## 1. What Does the Graph Represent?

The graph shows three possible trajectories of a payload released near Earth, plotted in a 2D plane with coordinates \(x\) and \(y\) (in kilometers). The trajectories depend on the payloadâ€™s initial velocity relative to Earthâ€™s escape speed:

- **Blue Lines**: Elliptical trajectories (sub-escape speed, elliptic).
- **Orange Line**: Parabolic trajectory (at escape speed, parabolic).
- **Green Line**: Hyperbolic trajectory (above escape speed, hyperbolic).
- **Purple Region**: Represents Earth, centered at the origin with a radius of approximately 6,371 km (Earthâ€™s radius).

The graph demonstrates how the payloadâ€™s path changes based on its velocity when released from a point near Earth. Unlike a simple graph, this one shows **multiple elliptical orbits**, indicating different sub-escape speeds.

---

## 2. Understanding the Axes and Setup

- **X-axis** (\(x\), km): Horizontal position of the payload, ranging from -12,000 km to 4,000 km.
- **Y-axis** (\(y\), km): Vertical position of the payload, ranging from 0 km to 14,000 km.
- **Earth**: The purple region at the origin represents Earth, with a radius of approximately 6,371 km.
- **Release Point**: The payload is released near Earth's surface, likely at the rightmost edge.

---

## 3. Escape Speed and Trajectories

The trajectories depend on the payloadâ€™s velocity compared to Earthâ€™s escape speed. The escape speed \(v_{\text{esc}}\) is the minimum speed required to escape Earth's gravitational pull without further propulsion.

Escape speed formula:

$$
v_{\text{esc}} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}
$$

Thus:

$$
GM \approx 3.986 \times 10^{14}\, \text{m}^3\text{s}^{-2}
$$

Then:

$$
v_{\text{esc}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 3.986 \times 10^{14}}{6.371 \times 10^6}} \approx 11,186\, \text{m/s} \approx 11.2\, \text{km/s}
$$

---

## 4. Analyzing the Trajectories

### Blue Lines: Elliptical Trajectories (Sub-escape Speed)

- **Description**: Payloadâ€™s speed is less than escape speed.
- **Path**: The payload follows elliptical orbits around Earth. Each blue line represents a closed loop.
- **Physics**: The total mechanical energy is negative:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{GMm}{r}
$$

---

### Orange Line: Parabolic Trajectory (At Escape Speed)

- **Path**: The payload follows a parabolic trajectory, moving asymptotically away from Earth.
- **Physics**: The total mechanical energy is zero:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2}mv_{\text{esc}}^2 - \frac{GMm}{r} = 0
$$

The payload slows down as it escapes, reaching zero velocity at infinity.

---

### Green Line: Hyperbolic Trajectory (Above Escape Speed)

- **Path**: The payload follows a hyperbolic trajectory, escaping Earthâ€™s gravity with excess velocity.
- **Physics**: The total mechanical energy is positive:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{GMm}{r} > 0
$$

The payload continues to move indefinitely with a nonzero velocity.

---

## 5. Interpreting the Graph

- **Elliptical (Blue)**: Multiple closed loops around Earth, representing bound stable orbits.
- **Parabolic (Orange)**: The payload just escapes Earth's gravity, slowing toward zero velocity at infinity.
- **Hyperbolic (Green)**: The payload escapes Earth's gravity completely with residual velocity.

The release point is tangential to Earth's surface, causing these orbital paths.

---

## 6. Applications

This graph is fundamental for:

- **Spacecraft Trajectories**: Deciding if the spacecraft will orbit or escape Earth.
- **Escape Velocity**: Critical for planning interplanetary missions.
- **Orbital Mechanics**: Understanding satellite orbits (elliptical) vs interstellar missions (hyperbolic).

---

# Summary

The graph illustrates the possible trajectories of a payload released near Earth based on its velocity relative to the escape speed $\approx 11.2$.

- **Elliptical (sub-escape speed)**: Bound orbits around Earth (blue).
- **Parabolic (at escape speed)**: Just escapes Earth, slowing to zero at infinity (orange).
- **Hyperbolic (above escape speed)**: Escapes Earth with excess speed (green).

These trajectories highlight the essential principles of orbital mechanics, governed by gravitational forces and the initial energy of the payload.

## OSIRIS-REx Trajectory July 2022 - October 2023

![alt text](OSIRIS-RExTrajectoryJuly2022-October2023-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif)

NASAâ€™s OSIRIS-REx is the first U.S. mission to collect a sample from an asteroid. The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft will deliver a capsule with fragments of asteroid Bennu to Earth on Sept. 24, 2023. The spacecraft briefly touched down on Bennu in October 2020 and gathered an estimated cupful of material. Seven months later, it departed Bennu on a 1.2-billion-mile cruise back to Earth. OSIRIS-REx will release the capsule above Earthâ€™s atmosphere for a landing in Utahâ€™s West Desert and continue flying past Earth. After delivering the sample, the spacecraft will adopt a new name for an extended mission to asteroid Apophis: OSIRIS-APEX. It will spend 5.5 years in an elliptical orbit of the Sun and rendezvous with Apophis in 2029. It will orbit and study Apophis for 1.5 years and then venture close to its surface to stir up loose material. 

This visualization depicts a portion (July 2022 â€“ October 2023) of the spacecraftâ€™s return cruise from Bennu to Earth.

# Trajectories of a Freely Released Payload Near Earth

This simulation explores the trajectories of a payload released from an altitude of 800 km above Earthâ€™s surface, given varying initial speeds. The payload is launched tangentially (perpendicular to the radial direction) with initial speeds ranging from 5 km/s to 13 km/s, in increments of 0.5 km/s.

---

## Earth and Initial Conditions

- Earth radius:  
  $$ R_{\text{earth}} = 6.371 \times 10^6 \ \text{m} $$

- Altitude of release:  
  $$ h = 800 \ \text{km} = 8.0 \times 10^5 \ \text{m} $$

- Initial position:  
  $$
  \vec{r}_0 = (R_{\text{earth}} + h, \ 0)
  $$

- Initial velocities (perpendicular to radius):  
  $$
  \vec{v}_0 = (0, \ v), \quad v \in \{5, 5.5, 6, \dots, 13\} \ \text{km/s}
  $$

---

## Gravitational Model

The only force acting on the payload is Earthâ€™s gravity, governed by Newtonâ€™s Law of Universal Gravitation:

$$
\vec{F}_g = -\frac{G M_{\text{earth}} m}{r^2} \hat{r}
$$

Using Newtonâ€™s Second Law:

$$
\vec{a} = \frac{\vec{F}}{m} = -\frac{G M_{\text{earth}}}{r^2} \hat{r}
$$

---

## Simulation Method

The simulation uses a basic numerical integrator (Euler method) with small time steps to compute the payloadâ€™s motion under gravitational acceleration. Each trajectory is terminated if the payload hits the Earth.

Initial conditions are varied by changing the speed \( v \) from 5 km/s to 13 km/s.

---

## Trajectory Classification

| Initial Speed (km/s) | Behavior                    | Trajectory Type   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
| 5.0 â€“ 7.0            | Reentry                     | Suborbital        |
| ~7.8 â€“ 8.0           | Near-circular orbit         | Elliptical/Circular |
| 8.5 â€“ 11.0           | Extended elliptical orbit   | Elliptical        |
| > 11.2               | Escape trajectory           | Hyperbolic        |

---

## Observations

- If $ v < 7.8 \ \text{km/s}, $
  the payload follows a suborbital or decaying elliptical path and eventually reenters Earth.

- If $ v \approx 7.8 \ \text{km/s}, $
  the payload enters a stable near-circular orbit.

- If $ 7.8 < v < 11.2 \ \text{km/s}, $
  the payload enters an elliptical orbit, possibly extending far from Earth depending on the exact speed.

- If $ v \geq 11.2 \ \text{km/s}, $
  the payload exceeds Earthâ€™s escape velocity and follows a hyperbolic path.

---

## Conclusion

The trajectory of a freely released payload near Earth is determined by its initial speed and direction. This simulation shows the transition from reentry, through orbital motion, to escape, based on increasing launch velocities. This analysis is fundamental to orbital mechanics and is applicable to satellite deployment, reentry planning, and deep space missions.
